# Portfolio

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Raquel, and this is my personal Data Science Portfolio. Here, I share some of my personal projects demonstrating data exploration, feature engineering, modeling, and predictive analysis.

## Projects

### Spaceship Titanic (Kaggle competition)

Welcome to the year 2912! ðŸš€ Here, I used my data science skills to investigate why nearly half of the Titanic passengers were transported to an alternate dimension.

In this folder, you can find a step-by-step guide including:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and imputation
- Feature engineering
- Model training, tuning, and evaluation
- **Kaggle submission achieving a score of 0.80173**
