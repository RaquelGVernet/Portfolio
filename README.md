# Portfolio (in progress)

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Raquel, and this is my personal Data Science Portfolio. Here, I share some of my personal projects demonstrating data exploration, feature engineering, modeling, and predictive analysis.

## Projects

### ðŸ§ª Clinical Trial project

This project is part of my data science portfolio and demonstrates how to design, simulate, and analyze data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Using a fictional scenario (the ALIEN-1 virus ðŸ§ª), I created a complete workflow that mirrors real-world clinical research.

In this folder, you can find a sep-by-step guide including:
- Experimental design - Simulation of a double-blind RCT with 700 patients across 4 treatment arms. 
- Database generation - Generation of patient-level clinical data including survival, recovery time, and biomarkers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Descriptive statistics and visualizations (boxplots, histograms, stacked barplots).
- Statistical analyses - Including Kaplanâ€“Meier survival curves & Log-rank tests, ANOVA & post-hoc Tukey tests, Chi-square tests
- Conclusions


### ðŸš€ Spaceship Titanic (Kaggle competition)

Welcome to the year 2912! ðŸš€ Here, I used **machine learning methods** to investigate why nearly half of the Titanic passengers were transported to an alternate dimension.

In this folder, you can find a step-by-step guide including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Descriptive analyses and visualizations (boxplots, histograms, barplots, scatterplots)
- Data cleaning and imputation - Domain-driven imputation rules
- Feature engineering - Creating new variables for improving the model performance
- Model training **(Ranfom Forest, XGBoost, Ensemble)**, hyperparameter tuning and evaluation
- **Kaggle submission achieving a score of 0.80173**
