# ðŸ§ª Clinical Trial Simulation & Analysis  

Welcome to my **Clinical Trial Simulation project**!   
This project simulates a **randomized controlled trial (RCT)** investigating the timing-dependent efficacy of a fictional treatment against the ALIEN-1 virus.

## Key Takeaways  

- **Early treatment** significantly reduces mortality, increases survival probability, and speeds recovery.  
- **Late treatment** is detrimental, leading to higher mortality and slower recovery.  
- Exploratory analyses suggest differences in post-treatment symptoms and biomarkers across groups.  
- Demonstrates use of **survival analysis, statistical hypothesis testing, and data visualization**
