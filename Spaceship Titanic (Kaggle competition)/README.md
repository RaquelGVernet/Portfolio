Welcome to my **Spaceship Titanic Kaggle project!** ðŸš€
This project investigates why nearly half of the Titanic passengers were transported to an alternate dimension.

You can find the datasets here:

And in this Folder you can find:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `1) Spaceship Titanic - EDA, Imputation and Feature Engineering.ipynb` | Notebook with data exploration, imputation, and feature engineering. |
| `2) Spaceship Titanic - Models and final submission.ipynb` | Notebook with model training (Random Forest, XGBoost), tuning, evaluation, and submission. |
| `processed_train.csv` | Preprocessed training dataset ready for modeling. |
| `processed_test.csv` | Preprocessed test dataset ready for modeling. |
| `spaceship_titanic_submission_0825_2.csv` | Final Kaggle submission file (score: 0.80173). |

## Key Takeaways

- Exploratory Data Analysis revealed important patterns and missing data.  
- Custom imputation and feature engineering improved model performance.  
- XGBoost was selected as the final model, achieving a **Kaggle score of 0.80173**.  
- Feature importance highlights **HomePlanet, TotalSpending, and CryoSleep** as the most predictive variables.
